Agents are more advanced over time, and the manifold capabilities has become a competitive space.
The capabilities at the edge, being the more advanced ones, are the more work-intensive ones. 
This means that when you ask for something advanced and drawn out, you are making a bigger wager.
Where one agent can be successful at a task, another may fail. So you either win big or lose big.

When there are internal conflicts of pattern, structure, or semantics, agents may fall into a 
pattern of vacillating between to states. This is because the agents tend to follow a narrow 
path of planning within the context, not aware of the larger picture. By focusing the agent onto 
a problem that was caused by fixing another problem, you may simply be sending it in circles. 
Agents aren't smart enough to detect this yet.

If you start down a path of declarative design for round-tripping from the top, and then you 
start interacting with the agents in a more piece-meal way, you may end up with a lot of 
conflicting changes. Thus, if you want to maintain the clarity of the declarative approach, it 
is important to keep the agents focused on the high-level design and not get bogged down in the 
details. Thus, you should avoid asking for changes to be made in a piecemeal way.

Project tainting. If you have lots of structure in your project which doesn't have the basic 
shape that you want, it may be nearly impossible to avoid having the agent re-pattern after the 
existing structure.
