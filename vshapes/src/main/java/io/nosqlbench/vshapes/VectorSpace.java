/// # VectorSpace Interface
///
/// Represents a vector space containing vectors for analysis.
/// This is the primary input data structure for all vector space analysis operations.
///
/// ## Purpose
/// - Provides a unified interface for accessing vector data
/// - Supports both labeled and unlabeled datasets  
/// - Enables caching of computational artifacts via unique identifiers
///
/// ## Usage
/// ```java
/// VectorSpace space = new MyVectorSpace("dataset-id", vectors, labels);
/// int count = space.getVectorCount();
/// float[] vector = space.getVector(0);
/// ```
///
/// ## Implementation Notes
/// - Vectors are expected to have consistent dimensionality
/// - Class labels are optional but required for supervised measures
/// - The `getId()` method should return a stable, unique identifier for caching
public interface VectorSpace {

    /// Gets the number of vectors in this space.
    /// 
    /// @return the vector count
    int getVectorCount();

    /// Gets the dimensionality of vectors in this space.
    /// All vectors in the space must have this dimensionality.
    /// 
    /// @return the vector dimension
    int getDimension();

    /// Gets a vector by index.
    /// 
    /// @param index the vector index (0-based)
    /// @return the vector as a float array (should be copied to prevent mutation)
    /// @throws IndexOutOfBoundsException if index is invalid
    float[] getVector(int index);

    /// Gets all vectors as a 2D array.
    /// 
    /// @return array where first index is vector, second is dimension
    float[][] getAllVectors();

    /// Gets the class label for a vector, if available.
    /// This is used for measures that require ground truth labels like margin analysis.
    /// 
    /// @param index the vector index
    /// @return the class label, or empty if not available
    Optional<Integer> getClassLabel(int index);

    /// Checks if this vector space has class labels.
    /// 
    /// @return true if class labels are available for analysis
    default boolean hasClassLabels() {
        return getVectorCount() > 0 && getClassLabel(0).isPresent();
    }

    /// 
    /// @return a unique identifier string
